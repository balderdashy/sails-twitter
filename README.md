# waterline-twitter

Provides easy access to `twitter` from Sails.js & Waterline.

This module is a Waterline/Sails adapter, an early implementation of a rapidly-developing, tool-agnostic data standard.  Its goal is to provide a set of declarative interfaces, conventions, and best-practices for integrating with all sorts of data sources.  Not just databases-- external APIs, proprietary web services, or even hardware.

Strict adherence to an adapter specification enables the (re)use of built-in generic test suites, standardized documentation, reasonable expectations around the API for your users, and overall, a more pleasant development experience for everyone.


### Installation

To install this adapter, run:

```sh
$ npm install waterline-twitter
```




### Usage

This adapter exposes the following methods:

###### `find()`

+ **Status**
  + Planned

###### `create()`

+ **Status**
  + Planned

###### `update()`

+ **Status**
  + Planned

###### `destroy()`

+ **Status**

### Interfaces

>TODO:
>Specify the interfaces this adapter will support.
>e.g. `This adapter implements the [semantic]() and [queryable]() interfaces.`
> For more information, check out this repository's [FAQ](./FAQ.md) and the [adapter interface reference](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/adapter-specification.md) in the Sails docs.


### Development

Check out **Connections** in the Sails docs, or see the `config/connections.js` file in a new Sails project for information on setting up adapters.

## Getting started
It's usually pretty easy to add your own adapters for integrating with proprietary systems or existing open APIs.  For most things, it's as easy as `require('some-module')` and mapping the appropriate methods to match waterline semantics.  To get started:

1. Fork this repository
2. Set up your `README.md` and `package.json` file.  Sails.js adapter module names are of the form sails-*, where * is the name of the datastore or service you're integrating with.
3. Build your adapter.




### Running the tests

Configure the interfaces you plan to support (and targeted version of Sails/Waterline) in the adapter's `package.json` file:

```javascript
{
  //...
  "sails": {
  	"adapter": {
	    "sailsVersion": "~0.10.0",
	    "implements": [
	      "semantic",
	      "queryable"
	    ]
	  }
  }
}
```

In your adapter's directory, run:

```sh
$ npm test
```


## Publish your adapter

> You're welcome to write proprietary adapters and use them any way you wish--
> these instructions are for releasing an open-source adapter.

1. Create a [new public repo](https://github.com/new) and add it as a remote (`git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/sails-youradaptername.git)
2. Make sure you attribute yourself as the author and set the license in the package.json to "MIT".
3. Run the tests one last time.
4. Do a [pull request to sails-docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/compare/) adding your repo to `data/adapters.js`.  Please let us know about any special instructions for usage/testing.
5. We'll update the documentation with information about your new adapter
6. Then everyone will adore you with lavish praises.  Mike might even send you jelly beans.

7. Run `npm version patch`
8. Run `git push && git push --tags`
9. Run `npm publish`
